We learned about using command line utilities to transfer data, did some trials on our machines. Command line arguments are necessary for this project since we have to work on param shavak for the training of huge dataset. The Dataset for earlier study was of 143 individual mugger identity and now the dataset has been expanded to 160 subjects. 
We met rahul sir for HPC param shavak access on our pC.
Also, learned about YOLO-v8, tried it out on a mock dataset. To gain insights of its architecture.
