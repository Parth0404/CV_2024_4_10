We successfully transferred Mugger dataset from our PC to HPC param shavak, we transferred it using FTP protocol. 
We explored the dataset for data preprocessing.
The combined dataset of the previos study and new field data has more than 31500 images of Mugger crocodiles, total 160 subjects.
Based on this points and taking Jai's advice we decided to extract every 10th image from each subject's folder for data preprocessing.
We wrote outputcode.py script to perform this.
