# Report 7

Date: 10/03/2024 - 16/03/2024

We filtered the whole data and have divided the data in train and validation and are ready with the code to train the model.

However, someother process is using the GPUs available and hence we are unable to begin.

We faced several issues this week. Firstly, we had trouble in getting the internet access on the param shavak which took two days to get access and then download the libraries required for the dataset and model to run.

We developed a new virtual environment for python on the param shavak. However, it only had python2.7 and to run yolo-v8 we require ultralytics library which only works on the python3.4 or higher version. We had set up a full environment of python 3.6 and downloaded all necessary libraries and sorted data. This took a lot of time because the connection kept closing unexpectedly sometimes.

Our model is ready to train and we are waiting for the GPUs to free up.
