# Report 6

This week, our primary focus was on creating a text file for each JPG and XML file in our dataset. The purpose of this text file is to store essential information about the bounding box annotations, specifically the class label, height, width, and x and y coordinates. This information is extracted directly from the corresponding XML file, which contains the annotation data in a structured format.

The rationale behind this approach is to prepare our dataset for training with the YOLOv8 object detection model. YOLOv8, like many other object detection models, requires the annotation data to be in a specific format, typically a text file containing the bounding box coordinates and class labels. By creating these text files, we ensure that our dataset is compatible with the model's input requirements.

To automate this process, we developed a code script that iterates through each XML file, parses the annotation data, and generates a corresponding text file with the required information. This script is designed to handle multiple classes and bounding boxes within each image, ensuring that all annotations are accurately captured in the text files.

The code for this script has been uploaded to our GitHub repository, allowing for easy access, collaboration, and version control. By completing this task, we have successfully prepared our dataset for the next phase of training and fine-tuning the YOLOv8 model on our custom dataset.
