We have worked on developing a Python script that automates the process of naming bounding box annotations with the corresponding class names. The script takes the current image file and the associated class names as input. It then parses the image to identify the bounding box annotations and their respective class names. For each annotation, the script generates an XML file that includes the class name in the header section and the class section.

The script is designed to streamline the annotation process and ensure consistency and accuracy. By automating the naming of bounding box annotations, we eliminate the risk of human error, such as assigning wrong class names or forgetting to name annotations. The script, written in Python, leverages various libraries for image processing, XML generation, and file manipulation tasks. The code is attached and also available in the code section. Implementing this script aims to improve the quality of our datasets and enhance the performance of machine learning models relying on accurate annotations.
