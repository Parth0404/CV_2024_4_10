This week, we delved into understanding the intricacies of the YOLOv8 model's functionality. Additionally, we addressed challenges related to different annotation formats by converting the Pascal dataset format to the YOLO format, ensuring compatibility for further model training and development. By streamlining the annotation process, we paved the way for seamless integration and optimization of the YOLOv8 model.
