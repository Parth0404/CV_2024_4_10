The dataset preparation process encountered an issue where the expected total file count of around 33,000 (JPG images and XML annotations) was not matching the actual extracted files, which were only 29,000. This discrepancy raised concerns about the completeness and accuracy of the dataset. The entire week was dedicated to debugging the code responsible for file extraction, specifically addressing issues with traversing through all folders/classes and handling different file naming conventions. After thorough code refinements and error handling improvements, we successfully extracted the full set of 33,000 files, ensuring the dataset's integrity for training the YOLOv8 object detection model.
