Introduction
This project aims to develop an efficient and accurate object detection system for Identifying Individual Crocodile Mugger. We will be leveraging the capabilities of the state-of-the-art YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithms, specifically YOLOv8, to achieve this goal. We met Jai Chaudhary who is going to guide us throughout the project. 
-We studied the architecture of YOLOv8, also the differences between YOLOv8 and YOLOv5.
- We also studied about different types of annotation techniques and what type of annotations has done the mugger dataset.
