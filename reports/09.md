The dataset preparation was nearing completion, with all the necessary components ready for the new 125 images for each class. We had successfully generated text files containing class labels, bounding box coordinates, and other relevant metadata extracted from the corresponding JPG images and XML annotation files. This comprehensive dataset, consisting of JPG images, XML annotations, and text files in the required format, laid the foundation for the next phase: training and fine-tuning the YOLOv8 object detection model on our custom dataset. With a properly formatted and organized dataset, we were well-positioned to achieve accurate and reliable object detection results.
