This week we had the dataset ready to train on param shavak but were told to redo the dataset by taking 125 images from each of 134 folders.
This was a whole new thing and had to figure out the code to do the redoing of whole dataset. The week firstly we discussed the dataset how will we built it a new and figured the things out with team members.
